# recall-file-encoding package

Restores last used encoding when opening a file

This is not a sofisticated package, it will just keep adding seeting to the database for each new file that is saved or for each file that is defined an encoding.

No provision to remove them on delete
No provision to change them on rename
No live checking is done to ensure file existence
